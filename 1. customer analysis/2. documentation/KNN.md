## Dataset Overview

The dataset now includes:

*   **Age** (Numerical): The age of individuals.
*   **Location** (Categorical): The individual's location, either "Urban" or "Rural."
*   **Gender** (Categorical): The individual's gender.
*   **Income** (Numerical): The individual's income in numerical form.
*   **Income\_Category** (Categorical): A categorized version of income:
    *   "$50,000 to $74,999"
    *   "$75,000 to $99,999"
    *   "upper\_outlier"
*   **Age\_Segment** (Categorical): Broad life stages based on age:
    *   "Emerging Adults"
    *   "Established Adults"
    *   "Experienced Adults"
    *   "Pre-Retirement"

## Step 1: Suitability for KNN

KNN works well when:

*   **Features and Target**: Predicting a numerical or categorical target is feasible.
*   **Distance Metrics**: Categorical features can be encoded for distance-based calculations.
*   **Outliers**: Income has an "upper\_outlier" category, which might bias distance calculations. Consider handling outliers.

## Step 2: Preprocessing the Data

1.  **Handle Categorical Features**

    Categorical features need to be converted into numerical format:

    *   **Location**: Map "Urban" to 1 and "Rural" to 0.
    *   **Gender**: Map "Male" to 1 and "Female" to 0.
    *   **Income\_Category**: Use ordinal encoding (if categories have order) or one-hot encoding (if not).
    *   **Age\_Segment**: Use one-hot encoding to preserve distinct life stages.
2.  **Scale Numerical Features**

    Standardize or normalize numerical features:

    *   Age and Income should be scaled to a similar range, as KNN relies on distance calculations.
3.  **Handle Outliers**

    The "upper\_outlier" in the Income\_Category might skew results. Consider:

    *   Imputing a capped value (e.g., above 99th percentile).
    *   Treating "upper\_outlier" as a separate class if predicting categories.

## Step 3: Determine Target and Features

**Possible Target Variables:**

*   **Income\_Category**: If predicting categories, this is a classification problem.
*   **Income**: If predicting the numerical income, this is a regression problem.

**Feature Variables:**

*   Use Age, Location, Gender, and encoded versions of Income\_Category and Age\_Segment.

## Step 4: Preprocessed Example

After preprocessing, the dataset might look like this:

| Age  | Location | Gender | Income | Income\_Category\_1 | Income\_Category\_2 | Income\_Category\_outlier | Age\_Segment\_Emerging | Age\_Segment\_Established | Age\_Segment\_Experienced | Age\_Segment\_Pre-Retirement |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 0.54 | 1        | 1      | 0.12   | 1                  | 0                  | 0                         | 0                     | 0                       | 1                        | 0                          |
| 0.69 | 1        | 1      | 0.13   | 0                  | 1                  | 0                         | 0                     | 0                       | 0                        | 1                          |
| 0.46 | 1        | 0      | 0.11   | 1                  | 0                  | 0                         | 0                     | 0                       | 1                        | 0                          |
| 0.32 | 1        | 0      | 0.13   | 1                  | 0                  | 0                         | 0                     | 1                       | 0                        | 0                          |
| 0.60 | 1        | 1      | 1.00   | 0                  | 0                  | 1                         | 0                     | 0                       | 0                        | 1                          |
| 0.25 | 0        | 0      | 0.12   | 1                  | 0                  | 0                         | 1                     | 0                       | 0                        | 0                          |

Here:

*   Numerical Features (Age, Income) are scaled between 0 and 1.
*   Categorical Features are encoded into binary or one-hot representations.

## Step 5: Analyze Suitability

**When to Use KNN:**

*   Predicting a clear target variable.
*   The dataset has sufficient size and diversity to find meaningful neighbors.
*   Features are encoded and scaled appropriately.

**When NOT to Use KNN:**

*   If the dataset is large (KNN becomes computationally expensive).
*   If there is class imbalance in the target (e.g., heavily skewed Income\_Category).
*   If the dataset contains too many outliers.

## Step 6: Assumptions for Correct Use

*   **Distance Assumption**: Features are relevant for distance computation.
*   **Representative Dataset**: Data is a good representation of the population.
*   **Low Noise**: Outliers and irrelevant features are minimized.
*   **Balanced Classes**: Avoid extreme class imbalances for classification tasks.
