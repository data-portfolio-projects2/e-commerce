## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how well we can classify individuals into income categories based on their personal and demographic information. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, and location, and we aim to predict the income category for each individual using these attributes. The income categories are predefined and represent different income levels.

### Key Questions

1. Can we accurately predict an individual's income category using the available features?
2. How well do the chosen features help in identifying the correct income category?
3. Are there any patterns or trends that can guide future decisions?

### Main Insights

The analysis shows that personal and demographic factors can effectively predict income categories when modeled correctly. Key features like age and location play a significant role in classification, but proper preprocessing is essential to achieve accurate results.

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains records of individuals with information about their age, gender, location, and predefined income categories. Key variables include:
- **Age:** Numerical value representing the individual’s age.
- **Gender:** Categorical value indicating the individual’s gender.
- **Location:** Categorical value representing the geographic region.
- **Income_Category:** The target variable, classifying individuals into income levels.

The data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency, including:
- Removing duplicates.
- Handling missing values.
- Scaling numerical features to ensure fair comparison during analysis.

### Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Preprocessed features by scaling numerical values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing subsets to evaluate performance.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Used the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which predicts income categories based on the similarity of individuals’ features.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Tested the model using unseen data to measure accuracy and reliability.

### Findings

- **Age:** Older individuals tend to belong to higher income categories.
- **Gender:** Minimal differences were observed in income categories across genders.
- **Location:** Geographic regions significantly influence income levels.
- **Model Accuracy:** KNN performed well, achieving a high accuracy in predicting income categories when the optimal number of neighbors (k) was selected.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. Personal and demographic features can effectively classify individuals into income categories.
2. The KNN algorithm provides reliable predictions when features are properly prepared.
3. Geographic location and age are the most influential factors in determining income categories.

### Challenges and Gaps

- Some features had limited influence on the classification, suggesting redundancy.
- Imbalanced distribution of income categories may skew predictions toward majority groups.

### Suggestions

1. Collect more data to balance income category representation.
2. Consider incorporating additional features, such as education level or employment type, for improved classification.
3. Use the findings to tailor targeted strategies, such as location-specific marketing or services.
