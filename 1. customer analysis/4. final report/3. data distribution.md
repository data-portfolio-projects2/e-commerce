## Findings on Age Distribution

**Age Range:** The ages in the dataset span approximately from 15 to 75 years.

**General Distribution:** The majority of the population is evenly distributed across age bins from 20 to 65 years. Each bin in this range has a frequency between 850 and 1000.

**Lower and Upper Age Groups:**

*   The population in the age range below 20 is slightly lower than the middle ranges.
*   The population above 65 shows a significant decrease, with a frequency of approximately 550.

**Conclusion:** The data indicates that most individuals fall within the working-age group (20â€“65), with fewer individuals in the younger and older age brackets.
