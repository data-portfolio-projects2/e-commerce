### Findings: 

**Age Range:** The ages in the dataset span approximately from 15 to 75 years.

**General Distribution:** The majority of the population is evenly distributed across age bins from 20 to 65 years. Each bin in this range has a frequency between 850 and 1000.

**Lower and Upper Age Groups:**

*   The population in the age range below 20 is slightly lower than the middle ranges.
*   The population above 65 shows a significant decrease, with a frequency of approximately 550.

**Conclusion:** The data indicates that most individuals fall within the working-age group (20â€“65), with fewer individuals in the younger and older age brackets.

## Histogram for Income

### Findings:

**Income Range:** The dataset includes incomes ranging from 0 to approximately 10 million.

**Skewness:** The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most individuals clustered near the lower end of the income range, particularly close to 0.

**Frequency Trends:**

*   The first income bin has the highest frequency, around 7,800 individuals.
*   Frequencies drop sharply after the first bin, with incomes above 2.5 million having frequencies of approximately 100 or fewer.

**Conclusion:** The majority of the population has low income levels, with very few individuals earning in the higher income brackets.

## Location Comparison

**Median Income:**

*   Rural locations have the highest median income compared to suburban and urban locations for both genders.
    *   Median income (Female): Rural > Suburban > Urban ($757,817 > $445,390 > $265,182)
    *   Median income (Male): Rural > Suburban > Urban ($904,286 > $514,073 > $281,942)

**Income Variation:**

*   Rural locations show the widest income variation (IQR) for both genders.
    *   Rural IQR (Male): $835,378
    *   Rural IQR (Female): $688,939
*   Urban locations have the lowest IQR for both genders.

**Whisker Range:**

*   Rural locations have the widest upper whisker range:
    *   Male: Rural ($2,157,352) > Suburban ($1,181,662) > Urban ($602,308)
    *   Female: Rural ($1,791,226) > Suburban ($1,011,184) > Urban ($560,508)

## Findings

**Gender Comparison:**

*   Males earn more than females across all locations.
*   Males have wider income variations than females.
*   Outliers are present in all locations, particularly in rural areas.

**Location Comparison:**

*   Rural locations have the highest median income and widest income variation.
*   Suburban and urban locations have lower median incomes and narrower income distributions.
*   Whisker ranges are higher in rural areas, suggesting a larger spread of incomes, particularly for males.

## Conclusion

Income patterns vary by location and gender, with rural areas showing higher incomes and wider income variation. Males generally earn more than females across all locations.

### Findings:

#### Median Income:

*   Rural locations have the highest median income for both genders.
*   Urban locations have the lowest median income for both genders.

#### Income Variation (IQR):

*   Rural locations show a wider income variation for both genders, with males having a larger IQR than females.
*   In suburban and urban locations, females have a slightly wider IQR compared to males.

#### Outliers:

*   Outliers are present above the whiskers for all locations and genders, representing individuals with exceptionally high incomes.

#### Conclusion:

Income patterns differ significantly by location and gender, with rural areas showing the highest income medians and greater variability. Outliers are evident across all categories.

### Findings

**Chart Overview:**

The chart displays log-transformed income distributions, broken down by income levels (Low, Medium, High) and age segments (Emerging Adults, Established Adults, Experienced Adults, Pre-Retirement).

**Low Income Level:**

*   Income distributions are similar across all age segments.
*   Outliers are present at the lower end of the distribution.

**Medium Income Level:**

*   Distributions are generally similar across all age segments.
*   The median income is higher than in the Low income category.
*   Outliers are observed at the lower end of the distribution.

**High Income Level:**

*   Age segments have a similar median income and interquartile range.
*   This category demonstrates the highest overall income levels.

**Overall Observations:**

*   Median income increases progressively from the Low to Medium to High income levels.
*   Income variation is low in the Low and Medium categories, but higher in the High category.
*   Within the High income level, the median income is relatively consistent across all age segments.

**Conclusion:**

Income levels and age segments show clear patterns. Higher income levels exhibit greater variability and progressively higher median incomes. Within the High income category, the median income is consistent across different age segments.

### Findings:

**Overview:**

The data presented analyzes log-transformed income distribution, categorized by age segments (Emerging Adults, Established Adults, Experienced Adults, Pre-Retirement) and income levels (Low, Medium, High).

**Low Income Level:**

*   Income distributions are similar across all age segments.
*   Outliers are observed at the lower end of the income range.

**Medium Income Level:**

*   Income distributions are consistent across age segments, with a higher median compared to the Low category.
*  Outliers are present at the lower end.

**High Income Level:**

*   All age segments exhibit similar income distributions with a higher median compared to the Medium and Low categories.
*   The interquartile range (IQR) is larger than in the other two income levels.

**Key Observation:**

*   For every age segment, income increases significantly as the income level progresses from Low to Medium to High.

**Conclusion:**

The income distributions are distinct and consistent within each income level, with clear progression in median income across levels for all age segments.
