![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e74981b-18e9-4eed-8d28-c516716dbd26)

### Findings: 

**Age Range:** The ages in the dataset span approximately from 15 to 75 years.

**General Distribution:** The majority of the population is evenly distributed across age bins from 20 to 65 years. Each bin in this range has a frequency between 850 and 1000.

**Lower and Upper Age Groups:**

*   The population in the age range below 20 is slightly lower than the middle ranges.
*   The population above 65 shows a significant decrease, with a frequency of approximately 550.

**Conclusion:** The data indicates that most individuals fall within the working-age group (20â€“65), with fewer individuals in the younger and older age brackets.

## Histogram for Income

### Findings:

**Income Range:** The dataset includes incomes ranging from 0 to approximately 10 million.

**Skewness:** The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most individuals clustered near the lower end of the income range, particularly close to 0.

**Frequency Trends:**

*   The first income bin has the highest frequency, around 7,800 individuals.
*   Frequencies drop sharply after the first bin, with incomes above 2.5 million having frequencies of approximately 100 or fewer.

**Conclusion:** The majority of the population has low income levels, with very few individuals earning in the higher income brackets.
