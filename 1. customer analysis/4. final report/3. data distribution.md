![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e74981b-18e9-4eed-8d28-c516716dbd26)

## Findings: 

**Age Range:** The ages in the dataset span approximately from 15 to 75 years.

**General Distribution:** The majority of the population is evenly distributed across age bins from 20 to 65 years. Each bin in this range has a frequency between 850 and 1000.

**Lower and Upper Age Groups:**

*   The population in the age range below 20 is slightly lower than the middle ranges.
*   The population above 65 shows a significant decrease, with a frequency of approximately 550.

**Conclusion:** The data indicates that most individuals fall within the working-age group (20â€“65), with fewer individuals in the younger and older age brackets.

## Histogram for Income

## Findings:

**Income Range:** The dataset includes incomes ranging from 0 to approximately 10 million.

**Skewness:** The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most individuals clustered near the lower end of the income range, particularly close to 0.

**Frequency Trends:**

*   The first income bin has the highest frequency, around 7,800 individuals.
*   Frequencies drop sharply after the first bin, with incomes above 2.5 million having frequencies of approximately 100 or fewer.

**Conclusion:** The majority of the population has low income levels, with very few individuals earning in the higher income brackets.

# Income Distribution by Age Segment Report

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study

This analysis explores income distribution across three income levels (Low, Medium, High) and four age segments (Emerging Adults, Established Adults, Experienced Adults, Pre-Retirement). Key statistics such as quartiles (Q1, Q3), IQR, and whiskers are calculated to understand income variability.

**Key variables analyzed:**

*   `Income_Level`: Low, Medium, High
*   `Age_Segment`: Emerging Adults, Established Adults, Experienced Adults, Pre-Retirement
*   `Q1`, `Q3`, `IQR`, `Lower_Whisker`

### Key Questions

*   How does income distribution vary by age segment and income level?
*   Are there significant differences in income spread across age segments?
*   Do any age segments show extreme income values?

### Main Insights

*   Income spreads are narrow for Low and Medium levels but wide for High income.
*   High-income segments show large outliers, particularly for Emerging Adults and Pre-Retirement.

*   Dataset Overview
*   Analysis of income distribution by age and income level
*   Key findings and recommendations
*   Supporting tables and visuals

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 12 records categorized by income level (Low, Medium, High) and age segment. Key statistics like Q1, Q3, IQR, and whiskers were calculated to describe income distribution.

### Steps in the Analysis

*   **Quartiles and IQR:** Calculated to show income spread within each group.
*   **Whiskers:** Identified outliers.
*   **Comparison:** Analyzed income differences by age segment and income level.

### Findings

**Low Income Level:**

*   Narrow IQR and minimal outliers across all age segments.

**Medium Income Level:**

*   Slightly wider IQR than Low, but no significant outliers.

**High Income Level:**

*   Wide IQR with large outliers, especially for Emerging Adults and Pre-Retirement.

**Key Observations:**

*   Low and Medium income levels have similar distributions with narrow IQRs.
*   High income shows extreme outliers in all age segments, particularly in Emerging Adults and Pre-Retirement.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

*   Income distribution is more consistent in Low and Medium levels, with a noticeable increase in variability for High income.
*   High-income segments have substantial outliers that require further examination.

### Challenges and Gaps

*   Outliers in the High-income group may skew overall trends.
*   Further segmentation of the High-income group is needed for more detailed analysis.

### Suggestions

*   Investigate the causes of outliers in the High-income segment.
*   Expand data collection for more granular insights into High-income distribution.
*   Consider targeted policies for age segments with wide income disparities.

## Findings:

**Overview:**

The data presented analyzes log-transformed income distribution, categorized by age segments (Emerging Adults, Established Adults, Experienced Adults, Pre-Retirement) and income levels (Low, Medium, High).

**Low Income Level:**

*   Income distributions are similar across all age segments.
*   Outliers are observed at the lower end of the income range.

**Medium Income Level:**

*   Income distributions are consistent across age segments, with a higher median compared to the Low category.
*  Outliers are present at the lower end.

**High Income Level:**

*   All age segments exhibit similar income distributions with a higher median compared to the Medium and Low categories.
*   The interquartile range (IQR) is larger than in the other two income levels.

**Key Observation:**

*   For every age segment, income increases significantly as the income level progresses from Low to Medium to High.

**Conclusion:**

The income distributions are distinct and consistent within each income level, with clear progression in median income across levels for all age segments.
