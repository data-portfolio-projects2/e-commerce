This document summarizes the analysis of pairwise comparisons between income categories using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values.

### 1. Understanding the Table Structure

The table presents the results of pairwise comparisons between different income categories. Each cell in the table displays the adjusted p-value for the comparison of two specific income categories. The p-values have been adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR).

### 2. Key Findings

*   All pairwise comparisons resulted in p-values less than 2e-16.
*   A p-value below a chosen significance threshold (commonly 0.05) signifies a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the two compared income categories.
*   In this analysis, every income category pair shows a significant difference in its distribution.

### 3. Interpretation

#### Statistical Significance:

*   The Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by pairwise comparisons, indicates a non-random and systematic distribution of counts across income categories.
*   This suggests that income categories exhibit meaningful differences in their distributions.

#### Magnitude of Differences:

*   While the tests demonstrate statistical significance between all pairs, they don't specify the magnitude of these differences.
*   Visualizations like boxplots or histograms, or the calculation of effect sizes, would be needed to evaluate the practical significance of these differences.

### 4. Practical Implications

*   The results indicate that income categories significantly influence the distribution of counts, implying a substantial imbalance across these categories.
*   When using these categories in modeling, such imbalances can lead to biased outcomes.
*   To mitigate this bias, strategies like resampling, weighting, or generating synthetic data may be necessary to address the class imbalance.
