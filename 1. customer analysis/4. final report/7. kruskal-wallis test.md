## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the distribution differences across income categories using the Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise comparisons. This analysis focuses on understanding whether the observed variations are statistically significant and systematic, providing insights into class imbalances within the dataset.

### Key Questions
*   Are there significant differences between income category distributions?
*   Are the observed differences systematic or random?
*   How might these findings influence future modeling or decision-making processes?

### Main Insights
*   All pairwise comparisons between income categories resulted in statistically significant differences, with adjusted p-values less than 2e-16.
*   The results suggest a systematic distribution across income categories, highlighting class imbalances.
*   Practical implications include addressing these imbalances to prevent biased modeling outcomes.

### Report Structure
*   **Dataset Overview:** Key dataset details and transformations.
*   **Analysis Steps:** Methods used, including statistical testing and visualization.
*   **Findings:** Summary of pairwise comparison results.
*   **Recommendations:** Addressing class imbalances and improving model performance.

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview
*   The dataset consists of multiple income categories, with varying sample sizes.
*   Transformations included outlier removal for incomes above $200,000 and low counts.

### Steps in the Analysis
*   **Kruskal-Wallis Test:** Assessed overall differences in income distributions.
*   **Pairwise Comparisons:** Conducted using Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values to control the false discovery rate.
*   **Visualization:** Proposed boxplots to illustrate variance across categories.

### Findings

#### Income Categories
*   Every pairwise comparison between income groups showed statistically significant differences (adjusted p-value < 2e-16).
*   The highest frequency category, "$50,000 to $74,999," exhibited marked differences compared to all other groups.

#### Systematic Distribution
*   Results indicate non-random distribution patterns, suggesting a need for careful handling of imbalanced classes.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings
*   Income categories significantly differ in distribution, emphasizing class imbalance.
*   Without addressing this imbalance, downstream analyses or machine learning models (e.g., KNN) may yield biased results.

### Challenges and Gaps
*   The imbalance in the "$50,000 to $74,999" income class could dominate modeling outcomes.
*   Additional exploratory analysis is required to assess the practical significance of observed differences.

### Suggestions
*   Segment the "$50,000 to $74,999" class and analyze separately to understand its internal variance.
*   Implement resampling techniques or synthetic data generation to balance the dataset.
*   Use visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to further investigate within-class variance.
