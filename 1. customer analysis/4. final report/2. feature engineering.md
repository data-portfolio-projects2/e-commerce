# Feature Engineering and its Impact on Customer Analysis

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study

This analysis aims to enhance customer data by creating new variables that provide more meaningful insights. The focus is on categorizing continuous variables (Income and Age) into specific groups to facilitate pattern and trend analysis. This study uses a customer dataset from an e-commerce platform, which includes data like Age, Location, Gender, and Income.

### Key Variables Analyzed:

*   Age
*   Location
*   Gender
*   Income

### Key Questions

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

*   Can we identify specific patterns or trends in the customer data?
*   How do demographic variables such as Income and Age impact customer segmentation?
*   Can we simplify our analysis by grouping data into categories that offer more meaningful insights?

### Main Insights

The creation of new variables, such as `Income_Level` and `Age_Segment`, allows for categorizing customers into meaningful groups. This provides a clearer understanding of customer demographics and simplifies further analysis by focusing on categories rather than individual data points.

### Report Structure

This report includes:

*   Overview of the dataset
*   Methods and steps used in the analysis
*   Key findings from the feature engineering process
*   Recommendations for using the newly created variables in customer analysis

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 10,000 customer records with the following key variables:

*   **Age:** Continuous data, ranging from 18 to 70 years.
*   **Income:** Continuous data, ranging from 31,044 to 9,992,571.

**Changes made to the data:**

*   Two new categorical variables were created: `Income_Level` and `Age_Segment`.
*   `Income_Level`: Categorizes customers into "Low", "Medium", and "High" income groups based on specific income ranges.
*   `Age_Segment`: Segments customers into age groups such as "Emerging Adults", "Established Adults", "Experienced Adults", and "Pre-Retirement".

### Steps in the Analysis

1.  The continuous variables `Income` and `Age` were transformed into categorical variables.
2.  These new variables were created using predefined ranges that align with common industry practices for segmentation.
3.  Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were used to summarize the data and visualize the distribution of each new variable.

### Findings

#### Income_Level:

*   The `Income_Level` variable divides customers into three categories:
    *   **Low:** Income below 68,446. This group represents customers with lower earnings.
    *   **Medium:** Income between 68,446 and 350,668. This group represents customers with middle-range earnings.
    *   **High:** Income above 350,668. This group represents customers with higher earnings.
*   The distribution shows that the majority of customers fall into the "Medium" income range, with a small percentage in the "Low" and "High" categories.

#### Age_Segment:

*   The `Age_Segment` variable divides customers into four distinct age groups:
    *   **Emerging Adults:** Age 18 to 30. This group represents younger individuals in the early stages of adulthood.
    *   **Established Adults:** Age 31 to 43. This group represents individuals who are in the prime of their careers and life.
    *   **Experienced Adults:** Age 44 to 56. This group represents individuals with substantial life and work experience.
    *   **Pre-Retirement:** Age 57 and above. This group represents individuals nearing retirement age.
*   The distribution shows that most customers belong to the "Established Adults" and "Experienced Adults" segments, with fewer customers in the "Emerging Adults" and "Pre-Retirement" groups.

#### Comparisons

*   The `Income_Level` and `Age_Segment` variables provide useful segmentation of the customer base.
*   These new variables allow for easier analysis of customer behavior based on income and age, enabling more targeted marketing and decision-making.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

*   Creating new categorical variables like `Income_Level` and `Age_Segment` provides clearer insights into customer demographics.
*   These new variables simplify the analysis by grouping continuous data into manageable categories.

### Challenges and Gaps

*   There were no significant challenges during the feature engineering process, though further refinement of the income and age categories may improve segmentation.
*   Some categories, such as income, may benefit from more granular segmentation depending on the specific business needs.

### Suggestions

*   Use the newly created variables to better understand customer preferences and target marketing efforts.
*   Consider refining the income and age categories to address more specific customer segments if required.

## 4. Supporting Information

### Visuals and Tables

*   Frequency tables for `Income_Level` and `Age_Segment` were created to show the distribution of customers across the new categories.
