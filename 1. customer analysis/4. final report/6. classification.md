# Addressing Data Imbalance in Income Category

## 1. Introduction

**Overview of the Study**

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the distribution of income categories and explore its implications for applying classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset represents individual income levels categorized into six groups and highlights potential challenges due to data imbalance.

**Key Questions**

*   Are the income categories evenly distributed?
*   What are the implications of an imbalanced dataset for applying KNN?
*   How can we address the data imbalance to gain meaningful insights?

**Main Insights**

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the income category "$50,000 to $74,999" comprising 5843 instances, significantly outnumbering other categories. This imbalance can lead to biased results with KNN. Further analysis is required to explore the dominant class separately.

**Report Structure**

*   Overview of the dataset and its distribution.
*   Explanation of analytical steps and findings.
*   Recommendations for addressing data imbalance.

## 2. Analysis

**Dataset Overview**

*   Size: Six income categories with a total of 7120 records.
*   Key Variables:
    *   `Income_Category`: The primary variable analyzed for distribution.

**Steps in the Analysis**

*   **Frequency Count**: Identified the distribution of records across categories.
*   **Evaluation of Data Imbalance**: Analyzed the impact of the dominant class on KNN.
*   **Proposed Segmentation**: Recommended isolating the dominant class and investigating it as a special case.

**Findings**

**Income Distribution:**

*   $25,000 to $34,999: 81 instances.
*   $35,000 to $49,999: 237 instances.
*   $50,000 to $74,999: 5843 instances (dominant class).
*   $75,000 to $99,999: 452 instances.
*   $100,000 to $149,999: 298 instances.
*   $150,000 to $200,000: 209 instances.

**Impact of Imbalance:**

*   The dominant class "$50,000 to $74,999" significantly skews the dataset, making it unsuitable for KNN without adjustments.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

**Key Findings**

*   The dataset's imbalance suggests that results from KNN would be heavily biased toward the dominant class.
*   Special handling of the "$50,000 to $74,999" category is necessary to ensure meaningful insights.

**Challenges and Gaps**

*   The imbalance limits the applicability of certain machine-learning methods.
*   Upper outliers (income > $200,000) need separate analysis.

**Suggestions**

*   Segment the dominant class and analyze it separately.
*   Investigate class variances using boxplots to study internal patterns within "$50,000 to $74,999."
*   Apply resampling techniques, such as undersampling or oversampling, for a balanced dataset.
