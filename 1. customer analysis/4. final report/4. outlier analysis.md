# Income Category Distribution Report

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the distribution of income across various categories within a given dataset. The dataset contains income ranges and their respective statistical summaries, including quartiles (Q1, Q3), interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers to detect outliers. The dataset represents a broad population sample and is intended to inform insights about income variability and anomalies across different income categories.

The key variables analyzed include:

*   `Income_Category`: The specific income ranges grouped into categories.
*   `Q1` and `Q3`: The first and third quartiles of income within each category.
*   `IQR`: The interquartile range, which measures the spread of the middle 50% of incomes.
*   `Lower Whisker` and `Upper Whisker`: Boundaries used to identify potential outliers within each category.

### Key Questions

This analysis aims to address the following key questions:

*   Are there noticeable patterns or trends in income distribution across different categories?
*   How do the income ranges vary by category, and what do the differences reveal about the data?
*   Are there any significant anomalies or outliers that need further investigation?

### Main Insights

Initial findings reveal that the income distribution within categories generally shows low variability, as indicated by minimal IQR values in most categories. However, the "upper\_outlier" category highlights extreme high-income data points that significantly differ from the rest of the categories.

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes seven income categories, each represented by the following key statistics: Q1, Q3, IQR, Lower Whisker, and Upper Whisker. The size of the dataset includes income data from a wide range of individuals or households. No significant data cleaning was required, though income values were formatted for readability.

### Steps in the Analysis

The analysis followed these steps:

1.  **Quartile Calculation**: Deriving the first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) for each income category.
2.  **IQR and Whisker Calculation**: Calculating the IQR for each category and determining the Lower and Upper Whiskers, which helped identify potential outliers.
3.  **Comparison of Income Categories**: Analyzing the income ranges across categories to understand income distribution and detect significant variations.

### Findings

#### Income Distribution

##### Income Category Trends

Each income category shows a low internal spread, as indicated by minimal IQR values. The IQRs of most categories are low, with the exception of some categories showing slightly larger IQRs, which suggest moderate variation in income within those ranges.

##### Outliers

The "upper\_outlier" category stands out with significantly higher income values. This category shows values as high as $9.35 million, which represent extreme high-income data points and require further investigation.

##### Specific Category Observations

*   **$25,000 to $34,999**

    *   Q1: $31,686
    *   Q3: $33,999
    *   IQR: $2,260
    *   This category has the smallest range, with minimal variation in income.

*   **$35,000 to $49,999**

    *   Q1: $38,715
    *   Q3: $46,100
    *   IQR: $7,385
    *   Slightly more variation than the previous category but still fairly consistent.

*   **$50,000 to $74,999**

    *   Q1: $67,063
    *   Q3: $72,400
    *   IQR: $5,333
    *   This category also shows a narrow range, with little internal spread.

*   **$75,000 to $99,999**

    *   Q1: $75,205
    *   Q3: $84,600
    *   IQR: $9,355
    *   Moderate variation within this category.

*   **$100,000 to $149,999**

    *   Q1: $112,291
    *   Q3: $137,000
    *   IQR: $24,200
    *   Greater variation, suggesting a broader income spread within this category.

*   **$150,000 to $200,000**

    *   Q1: $160,893
    *   Q3: $186,000
    *   IQR: $24,700
    *   Significant range between the first and third quartile.

*   **Upper Outlier**

    *   Q1: $557,915
    *   Q3: $4,080,000
    *   IQR: $3,520,000
    *   This category shows extremely high values, with outliers at the upper end of the spectrum.

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

*   Income distribution within the standard categories shows a high degree of consistency, with most categories exhibiting low internal variation.
*   The upper\_outlier category reveals extreme high-income values, which stand out significantly from the rest of the data and may require separate handling to avoid distorting overall statistics.

### Challenges and Gaps

*   **Uniformity of IQR**: Most categories display minimal variance, making it difficult to detect detailed trends within each group.
*   **Handling Outliers**: The upper outlier category could skew the analysis, and its extreme values may require different treatment or further investigation.

### Suggestions

*   **Focus on Outliers**: A deeper investigation into the "upper\_outlier" category is recommended to understand whether there are meaningful sub-patterns or if data collection methods should be revisited.
*   **Data Expansion**: Consider adding more granular income categories to detect subtler variations between groups and provide a richer understanding of the income distribution.
