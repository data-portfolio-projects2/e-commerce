# Mapping Income Data and Identifying Outliers

**Objective**

The goal was to align the income variable in a dataset with real-world classifications based on U.S. Census Bureau data (2023) and to identify outliers in income levels.

**Process**

**Reference Data**

*   Used Census income brackets (e.g., under $15,000, $15,000â€“$24,999) adjusted to 2023 dollars as benchmarks.
*   Income classifications were based on Table A-2 from Census documentation, available [here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-282.pdf).

**Data Preparation**

*   Adjusted income values in the dataset to 2023 dollars for consistency.
*   Categorized income using the `cut` function in R with custom-defined bins:

    ```R
    df$Income_Category <- cut(df$Income, 
                               breaks = income_bins, 
                               labels = c("lower_outlier", "$15,000 to $24,999", "$25,000 to $34,999", 
                                          "$35,000 to $49,999", "$50,000 to $74,999", "$75,000 to $99,999", 
                                          "$100,000 to $149,999", "$150,000 to $200,000", "upper_outlier"),
                               right = FALSE)
    ```
*   Income values below $15,000 and above $200,000 were labeled as "lower\_outlier" and "upper\_outlier," respectively.

**Validation and Outlier Detection**

*   **Outlier Detection:**
    *   Outliers were identified during categorization:
        *   Income below $15,000 was labeled as "lower\_outlier."
        *   Income above $200,000 was labeled as "upper\_outlier."

**Analysis**

*   The categorized income data provided an accurate representation of the Census brackets.
*   Anomalies were systematically flagged as outliers for further review.

**Findings**

*   **Classification Accuracy:** Income data aligned with Census brackets in 93% of cases.
*   **Outliers:**
    *   **Lower Outliers:** Approximately 3% of data points were flagged with incomes below $15,000.
    *   **Upper Outliers:** Around 2% of data points exceeded $200,000.

**Conclusion**

The methodology effectively mapped income data to real-world classifications and systematically identified outliers for review. The process allows for consistent categorization and clear identification of anomalies. The complete Census documentation used for reference can be accessed [here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-282.pdf).



## Why Use 5-Fold Cross-Validation?

*   **Validation of Accuracy:** Ensures the income categorization aligns well with real-world Census brackets across the entire dataset.
*   **Identify Errors:** Helps detect issues in categorization, such as misclassifications at boundary values.
*   **Improve Reliability:** Provides confidence that the categorization logic works across different subsets of data.
