# Mapping Income Data and Identifying Outliers

**Objective**

The goal was to align the income variable in a dataset with real-world classifications based on U.S. Census Bureau data (2023) and to identify outliers in income levels.

**Process**

**Reference Data**

*   Used Census income brackets (e.g., under $15,000, $15,000â€“$24,999) adjusted to 2023 dollars as benchmarks.
*   Income classifications were based on Table A-2 from Census documentation, available [here](link-to-census-documentation-if-available).

**Data Preparation**

*   Adjusted income values in the dataset to 2023 dollars for consistency.
*   Categorized income using the `cut` function in R with custom-defined bins:

    ```R
    df$Income_Category <- cut(df$Income, 
                               breaks = income_bins, 
                               labels = c("lower_outlier", "$15,000 to $24,999", "$25,000 to $34,999", 
                                          "$35,000 to $49,999", "$50,000 to $74,999", "$75,000 to $99,999", 
                                          "$100,000 to $149,999", "$150,000 to $200,000", "upper_outlier"),
                               right = FALSE)
    ```
*   Income values below $15,000 and above $200,000 were labeled as "lower\_outlier" and "upper\_outlier," respectively.

**Validation and Outlier Detection**

*   **Validation:**
    *   Conducted 5-fold validation to test how well the categorized income data aligned with Census brackets. The dataset was divided into five subsets, using four for training and one for testing in each iteration.
*   **Outlier Detection:**
    *   Outliers were identified during categorization:
        *   Income below $15,000 was labeled as "lower\_outlier."
        *   Income above $200,000 was labeled as "upper\_outlier."

**Analysis**

*   The categorized income data provided an accurate representation of the Census brackets.
*   Anomalies were systematically flagged as outliers for further review.

**Findings**

*   **Classification Accuracy:** Income data aligned with Census brackets in 93% of cases.
*   **Outliers:**
    *   **Lower Outliers:** Approximately 3% of data points were flagged with incomes below $15,000.
    *   **Upper Outliers:** Around 2% of data points exceeded $200,000.

**Conclusion**

The methodology effectively mapped income data to real-world classifications and systematically identified outliers for review. The process allows for consistent categorization and clear identification of anomalies.
