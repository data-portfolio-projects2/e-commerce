# Income Category Distribution Report

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Study

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the distribution of income across various categories, as captured in the provided dataset. The dataset represents income ranges and their respective statistical summaries, such as quartiles (Q1, Q3), interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers.

The key variables analyzed include:
- **Income_Category**: Ranges of income grouped into categories.
- **Q1 and Q3**: The first and third quartiles of income within each category.
- **IQR**: The interquartile range, which measures the spread of the middle 50% of incomes.
- **Lower_Whisker and Upper_Whisker**: Calculated bounds for identifying outliers within each category.

### Key Questions

This analysis aims to address the following questions:
- Are there patterns in income distribution across different categories?
- How do income ranges vary by category?
- Are there any noticeable outliers or anomalies?

### Main Insights

Initial findings indicate that the income distribution is consistent within categories, with minimal variation as indicated by zero or low IQR values for most categories. However, the "upper_outlier" category exhibits significantly higher values, highlighting extreme incomes as outliers.

## 2. Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of seven income categories, each represented by its range and statistical summaries. Key transformations include:
- Formatting income values for readability.
- Adjusting categories to ensure clarity.

### Steps in the Analysis

The analysis involved:
1. **Calculating Quartiles**: Deriving Q1 and Q3 for each income category.
2. **Determining IQR and Whiskers**: Using standard formulas to identify spread and potential outliers.
3. **Analyzing Distribution**: Comparing income ranges across categories.

### Findings

#### Income Distribution

- **Income Categories**:
  - Each income category exhibits no internal spread (IQR = 0) except for slight variation in some.

#### Notable Insights

1. **Low Variance in Categories**:
   - Most categories exhibit consistent income ranges with identical Q1 and Q3 values.

2. **Extreme Outliers**:
   - The "upper_outlier" category shows significantly higher values, indicating the presence of extreme high-income data points.

#### Summary Table

| Income Category      | Q1         | Q3         | IQR        | Lower Whisker | Upper Whisker |
|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| $25,000 to $34,999  | 31,686     | 33,999     | 2,260      | 31,044        | 34,972        |
| $35,000 to $49,999  | 38,715     | 46,100     | 7,385      | 35,071        | 49,949        |
| $50,000 to $74,999  | 67,063     | 72,400     | 5,333      | 59,064        | 74,998        |
| $75,000 to $99,999  | 75,205     | 84,600     | 9,355      | 75,000        | 98,577        |
| $100,000 to $149,999| 112,291    | 137,000    | 24,200     | 100,248       | 149,872       |
| $150,000 to $200,000| 160,893    | 186,000    | 24,700     | 150,017       | 199,203       |
| Upper Outlier        | 557,915    | 4,080,000  | 3,520,000  | 200,517       | 9,351,458     |

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. Income distributions within standard categories are tightly clustered, with minimal variance.
2. The "upper_outlier" category reveals extreme values, suggesting a need to explore data collection processes or targeted policies for this segment.

### Challenges and Gaps

1. **Uniform IQR in Standard Categories**:
   - Minimal variance limits deeper analysis of within-category trends.
2. **Upper Outliers**:
   - These values may distort aggregate statistics and require separate handling.

### Suggestions

1. **Focus on Outliers**:
   - Further investigate the "upper_outlier" category for potential sub-patterns.
2. **Data Expansion**:
   - Incorporate more granular categories to capture nuanced differences.
