# Customer Demographics Analysis

This report provides a brief overview of the customer demographic data we are working with. The dataset contains 10,000 records with four key variables: Age, Location, Gender, and Income. These variables help us understand the composition of our customer base, which is crucial for tailoring marketing and sales strategies.

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:

*   **Age:** The age of each customer (numeric).
*   **Location:** The geographical location of the customer (categorical).
*   **Gender:** The gender of the customer (categorical).
*   **Income:** The income level of the customer (numeric).

All columns contain 10,000 entries with no missing data.

## Data Types

*   **Age** and **Income** are numerical values (integers), representing customer age and income.
*   **Location** and **Gender** are categorical variables, providing information about where customers are located and their gender.

## Next Steps

In the following stages of the project, we will dive deeper into processing and analyzing this data. This will allow us to identify key customer segments and trends that will help shape business strategies. We will keep the analysis simple and easy to follow, focusing on practical insights to guide decision-making.
